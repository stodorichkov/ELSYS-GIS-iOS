# MarkMe (ELSYS-GIS-iOS)

__Idea description:__<br>

A geographic information system for gathering circumstances in an urban environment via iOS devices. It works on the principle that each user can create a separate circumstance and share it with everyone else. Thus, everyone can fulfill their civic duty in a situation in which they witnessed a polluted area with waste or a substance dangerous to humans and living organisms, a burst pipe, a broken electric cable, a collapsed electric pole, a collapsing building, an accident, etc.
